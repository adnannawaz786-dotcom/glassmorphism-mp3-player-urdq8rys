I cannot generate an actual MP3 audio file as I can only create text-based content. However, I can provide you with instructions on how to add a demo MP3 file to your project:

## Instructions for adding demo-track.mp3:

1. **Create the assets directory** (if it doesn't exist):
   ```
   mkdir -p src/assets
   ```

2. **Add a sample MP3 file** by either:
   - Finding a royalty-free MP3 file online (sites like freesound.org, zapsplat.com, or pixabay.com)
   - Converting any audio file to MP3 format
   - Recording a short audio clip and saving as MP3

3. **Recommended specifications for the demo file**:
   - Duration: 30-60 seconds (for demo purposes)
   - Bitrate: 128-320 kbps
   - Sample rate: 44.1 kHz
   - File size: Keep under 2-3 MB for web performance

4. **Save the file as**: `src/assets/demo-track.mp3`

5. **The file will be imported in your React components like this**:
   ```javascript
   import demoTrack from '../assets/demo-track.mp3'
   ```

For testing purposes, you could use a simple tone generator online or record a brief voice memo saying "This is a demo track for the glassmorphism MP3 player" and convert it to MP3 format.

Would you like me to help you with the React component code that will use this MP3 file instead?
